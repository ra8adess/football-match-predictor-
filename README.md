# football-match-predictor-

⚽ Football Match Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts the outcomes of football matches based on historical data and key match features such as team statistics, recent performance, and other relevant factors.

📌 Features
Predict match outcome: Win / Lose / Draw

Analyze team performance and form

Interactive data visualization (if applicable)

Trained using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

(Optional) Web interface or CLI interface
